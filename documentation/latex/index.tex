The {\bfseries goal} is to design a {\itshape labeled two class data set} of 10-\/dimensional vectors that has test set classification accuracy less than 60\% on some popular classifiers. However, our decision rule was designed such that it can perform with greater than 90\% accuracy on the test set.

\subsection*{Overview}

\subsubsection*{Data Set Generation}

{\ttfamily \hyperlink{data__generation_8py}{data\+\_\+generation.\+py}} is a {\itshape toolbox} written in Python for data set generation satisfying the problem specifications. We generate a data set of 100,000 10-\/dimensional vectors (components), where 3 out them are relevant.

Decision rules and data set generation using 10 components and discrete values (from 0 to 9) for supervised learning \hyperlink{namespacelearning__driver}{learning\+\_\+driver}. The number of decision rules is reduced exponentially based upon the level of \hyperlink{namespacemate__learning}{mate\+\_\+learning} (grouping of values) applied across the selected relevant components.

\subsubsection*{Learning Method}

Supervised Learning method for binary classification based on mating (grouping of values) across the supplied data set of components and classification labels. The learning algorithm is implemented in '\hyperlink{mate__learning_8py}{mate\+\_\+learning.\+py}`. It consists of exhausting all the possibilities as long as accuracy of correct classification can be increased.

We define a {\ttfamily Mate\+Finder} class for the particular binary classification problem based on mates (usually groups of 2 -\/ pairs) across each component of a discrete-\/valued data set. The {\ttfamily Mate\+Finder} class provides procedures such as the removal of irrelevant components (selection of relevant components), as well as essential learning (training and validation) and testing procedures from learned decision tables of pairs.

Once a {\ttfamily Mate\+Finder} object has been instantiated through the constructor, the interfacing methods employed by an external classifier are\+: {\ttfamily learn\+\_\+by\+\_\+mate\+\_\+discovery()} and {\ttfamily compute\+\_\+prediction\+\_\+accuracy()}

The program driving the learning from data and estimating the accuracy of the learned decision rule on the testing set is driven by {\ttfamily \hyperlink{learning__driver_8py}{learning\+\_\+driver.\+py}}

\subsection*{Installing}

\subsubsection*{From source}

It's {\bfseries Python}! Only the \href{http://numpy.org}{\tt Numpy} module is required.

After fulfilling the module dependencies, just run the scripts, such as\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ python data_generation.py
